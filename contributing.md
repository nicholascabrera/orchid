# Contributing to Orchid
Orchid is actively seeking contributors to help with a wide variety of tasks from documentation, website design, community building, and code contributions.

Things to note if you plan to contribute:

- There is a strict **ban** on the use of any AI for pull requests that deal with the actual `orchid` tool.
- AI usage is generally restricted for issues and pull requests, if it is used then it must be noted in the pull request itself.
- Check the issues for tasks to complete, if there's no issue then you can suggest one.
- Keep test coverage high with unit tests and functional tests.

## Ground Rules
We are not in the coding phase yet - still in the dreaded documentation and diagramming phase. Also known as the most important phase of the project.
