# Orchid
This tool is a free, open source secure file and secrets manager primarily in local storage or on a self-hosted NAS.

This project is extremely new and is still in the planning phases.

## The Plan
There are limited options for password managers and secure file managers for those that want fine grained control over their security policies without creating their own tools. Orchid aims to achieve a minimum viable security policy while allowing users to freely customize their policies on:
- encryption schemes and algorithms
- password generation algorithms, regeneration, and auditing
- tool logging
- salting
- database hosting, database versioning, database adapters
- more restrictive input sanitization and handling
- RNG source
- more when ideas become available

As well as choose between hosting this information locally, on a self-hosted NAS, or on the cloud (AWS, Azure, whatever).

The plan is to implement the core subsystems and customizations, local storage, and a fast, lightweight CLI as the minimum viable product (V1).
